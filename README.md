# landing-page

15 Jan. 2023  
This is a website landing page for all of my stuff and the final project in The Odin Project - flexbox unit.

First step I am going to build my index.html page and lay out all my pieces.  I'll do that by building my boilerplate, then structure my <body> into the sections I am going to need.  

Second I'l fill in all my actual information.  I like to leave spaces between my items and tags so that I can easily see them while laying out my data
 
Third, I can start at the top and start building my boxes in CSS.  The idea is to build the example to a T first, then go back and customize.

Things I know I will need to find are: Clear images from our photo files that I can put on the landing page that will be relavant. Also, image icons to my socials that I can use for links.

There's no way I'll get it all done today, but I digress, lets get at it...after I warm up my coffee...
